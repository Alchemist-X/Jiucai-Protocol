## Why We Built This
- **A simple way to meet blockchain users‚Äô needs for high-risk, high-reward, and transparent speculation**
- **Traditional lotteries have an expected return of -45%. We aim for -5% so users can enjoy the ‚ÄúPhD‚Äù (wordplay on gambling) experience with lower losses**

# User Guide

## Placing a Bet

Users place bets using crypto assets. The demo version uses Sepolia ETH, with each bet costing **0.0000996 ETH**. Each address can place up to **6 bets**. After placing a bet, users receive a **unique lottery number**.

## Lottery Draw

After the draw, the smart contract **automatically distributes** prizes based on the lottery rules.  
<span style="color:red">Winners pay the transaction fee, and non-winners receive a notification.</span>  
The platform covers the notification fee, and platform fees are sent to a **designated regulatory address**.  
Referral rewards are distributed to the respective promoters.

## Referral System

- **Parent nodes earn 2.5% and 0.5% of the betting amount from their direct and indirect referrals (children and grandchildren).**  
- Players receive a referral link with a unique code, which they can share in **Telegram groups** or other platforms.  
- If a participant **has no referrer**, the full amount (after platform fees) goes into the prize pool.  
- The referral system is **limited to two levels** (parent-child-grandchild structure).

## Lottery Rules

The lottery offers multiple mechanisms, varying in **difficulty and volatility (standard deviation)**.  
After launch, **1-2 main types** will be promoted, while others compete for growth data.

### Daily 3 Lottery (Prototype: Demo limited to 6 bets)

- **EV** = **-5%** (0.498$)  
- **Prize Pool Composition**:  
  Total Prize Pool = Player Bets - **Platform Fee (up to 2%)** - **Referral Rewards (up to 3%)** - **Blockchain Transaction Fees** + **Foundation Grant (up to 3%)**  

### Prize Distribution

A draw occurs when the **maximum number of bets (1000)** is reached or the deadline is met.  
If no **foundation grant** is provided, the total prize pool is **0.9462 ETH**.  
Winning numbers are randomly selected, and each number **can only win once**.
